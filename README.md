Hello, welcome to my portfolio for data analysis
This is a collection of projects that i have completed on my own time to showcase my ability and knowledge in data analytics. 
I have learned coding through online courses, source Codecademy. While the structure and information in the platfrom was great, practice still makes perfect.
I have a MBA, but I know I want to be in Analytics, so instead of going back to school I chose to learn online for a lot less.
Extremely fast learner and Excellent work ethic, problem-solving is a specialty.
Skills: Python, SQL, Tableau, Microsoft Excel
